    p.
      I am a developer with over years of experience creating web applications.
      Between january 2006 and january 2014, I worked as a consultant for Ciber Netherlands B.V. within the ECM & Portals
      service line.
      I have over  years of experience writing Ruby on Rails web applications. Once I discovered Ruby,
      there was no way back for me. I gain much satisfaction from programming in Ruby. In january 2014
      I started as a freelancer. I enjoy using the latest techniques and adhering to best practices.
      I take pride in creating beautiful and minimal code.

      I was born in Utrecht, the Netherlands on may 17th, 1974. I graduated in Cognitive Artificial Intelligence at the
      Faculty of Philosophy, Utrecht University.
      After I received my Master's degree I went to Japan several times, over a period of three years,
      to practice Zen training at Tofukuji, a Kyoto based Rinzai Zen Monastery.
      In february 2006 my daughter Nola was born.
      Nowadays I still live in Utrecht, co-parenting my daughter, in a lovely neighborhood, with my girlfriend Elske
      living nearby.
